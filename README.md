Tire fitment engine

We’re going to recreate the fitment engine that you see on tirebuyer.com. 

Clicking the button on the home page fires an API call and returns a list of years (2018, 2017, 2016, etc.). This is alredy built in Angular and NGRX.

Task 1: style this list of years as a grid, similar to tirebuyer.com.

Task 2:
Clicking on one of the years should append that value (e.g. "2015") to another API call, which will return a list of vehicle makes (Audi, Ford, Subaru, etc.). Display these in a similar grid format. 

Repeat this process to show vehicle model, and style.
